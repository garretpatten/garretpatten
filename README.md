- 👋 Hi, I’m @garretpatten.
- 👀 I’m interested in: hardware, networks, app & info sec, a11y, OSS, linux, and anything-CLI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning application security and linux concepts, working as a Security Engineer and tinkering with a personal machine running Fedora. At the moment, I'm using quite a bit of Postman and BurpSuite and going through PortSwigger's Web Security Academy in addition to the development I do at work and on the side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on OSS
- 📫 How to reach me: garret.patten@proton.me
