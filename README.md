### About Me

I'm a systems-minded engineer with a builder's mindset and experience spanning QA, software engineering, and security.

I design and build automation and infrastructure that reduce friction and risk: reproducible environments, secure pipelines, and durable systems that make correctness the default. My background includes years of building and operating customer-facing platforms with a focus on accessibility, reusable architectures, and scale.

### Engineering Philosophy

- Simplicity is the apex of design; complexity signals incomplete understanding.
- Outcomes are the objective; implementations are transient and disposable.
- Quality is a prerequisite; security, correctness, and reliability are constraints, not aspirations.
