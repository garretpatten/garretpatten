### About Me

I'm a systems-minded engineer with a builder's mindset and experience spanning QA, software engineering, and security.

I design and build automation and infrastructure that reduce friction and risk: reproducible environments, secure pipelines, and durable systems that make correctness the default. My background includes years of building and operating customer-facing platforms, with a focus on accessibility, reusable architectures, and scale.

### Engineering Philosophy

- Simplicity is the apex of design. Complexity signals incomplete understanding; mastery is revealed through clarity and minimalism.
- Outcomes are the objective. Implementations are transient; attachment to code obscures results.
- Quality is the prerequisite. Security, correctness, and auditability are constraints—not aspirations.
