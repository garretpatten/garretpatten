I'm a systems-minded software engineer with a builder’s mindset and a QA engineer’s attention to detail.  
I design secure pipelines, build resilient tools, and advocate for accessibility and correctness across the stack.

### 🧭 Journey

- Started in **QA** — learned to test like an adversary and think in edge cases  
- Moved into **engineering** — built accessible, high-stakes web apps for financial platforms  
- Transitioned to **security** — applied offensive and defensive techniques to harden real systems  
- Now focused on **tooling and infrastructure** that make secure delivery the default

---

### ⚙️ What I Build

- CI/CD systems (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, hardened runners, secure artifacts, deployment automation)
- Backend tools and internal platforms that enable dev velocity without compromising security
- Frontend components and frameworks with first-class accessibility (WCAG AA+)
- Cross-cutting automation in Python, Bash, JS, and other fit-for-purpose tools

---

### 🔐 Security Engineering

- Secure SDLC design: threat modeling, shift left, least privilege, manual and automated negative-path testing
- Supply chain and pipeline hardening: WAFs, isolation, artifact verification, defense-in-depth
- Policy-as-code, SAST/DAST integration, and practical risk management

---

### 📐 Engineering Philosophy

- Maintainability is non-negotiable
- Accessibility is part of quality
- Privacy, correctness, and ethics matter

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Open Source

- Author of [Semgrep Apex Ruleset](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-rules/tree/develop/apex) for Salesforce static analysis
- Contributor to FOSS tools that improve efficiency, security, and developer workflows
