# Hey, I'm Garret!

I'm a systems-minded security engineer with a builder's mindset and seven years of experience spanning QA, software engineering, and security. I design secure pipelines and scalable processes, drive developer enablement programs, and advocate for security as a shared organizational responsibility.

### 📐 Engineering Philosophy

- Simplicity is the apex of design. Complexity often signals incomplete understanding; mastery is measured by the clarity and minimalism of the solution.
- Be outcome-driven, not implementation-attached. Code is temporary; results are the objective.
- Quality is the prerequisite. Security, correctness, and auditability are constraints, not aspirations.
