I am a systems-minded security engineer with a builder's mindset and seven years of experience spanning QA, software engineering, and security. I design secure pipelines and scalable processes, drive developer enablement programs, and advocate for security as a shared organizational responsibility.

### 📐 Engineering Philosophy

- Simplicity is the apex of design. Complexity is a failure of vision; mastery is measured by the clarity and minimalism of the solution.
- Be outcome-driven, not implementation-attached. Code is temporary; results are the objective. Cultivate rigor without sentimentality.
- Quality is the prerequisite. Security, correctness, and auditability are non-negotiable constraints, not aspirational features.
